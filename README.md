# Twitter Data Pipeline using Apache Airflow
1. In this project we will build a simple end to end data pipeline project.
2. Firstly we will extract data from twitter using tweepy API and then will use pandas to transform the data.
3. After the transformation, we will deploy our code on to Apache Airflow running on an EC2 Machine.
4. At the end we will store our data in S3 bucket.
